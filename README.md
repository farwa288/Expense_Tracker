# Expense_Tracker

In this task, I created step-by-step to build the app from scaratch,starting with HTML structure and styling it with CSS. Then,I dive into the javascript code to add interactivity and functionality,including the ability to add new expense,calculate totals,and display the data in a clean,user-friendly format.
